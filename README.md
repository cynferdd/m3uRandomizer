# m3uRandomizer
a utility program used to randomize a .m3u file with the #EXTM3U format

it was coded really quickly as I needed to do it for a task only 2 days after (making a playlist for a wedding dinner from multiples albums, without taking too much time to do it, and removing anything longer than 8 minutes)

there may be some cleaning in the future, and maybe changing naming and comments (now in french, later in english)
